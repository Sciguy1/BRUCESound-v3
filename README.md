# BRUCESoundEngine-v3
 A sound engine that can be used in homebrew games/engines. Uses LWJGL 3.x and parts of 2.x for ease of use with OpenAL.
 Note: The size is half due to the wav files, you can have the option of removing those, as this is still being tested
 with additional functionality.

12-30-2020 - A jar file for library integration will be coming soon.
