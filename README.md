# BRUCESoundEngine #
 **Still developing and in its rough stages**
 
  A minimal sound engine that can be used in homebrew games/engines. Uses LWJGL 3.x and parts of 2.x for ease of use with OpenAL.
  Note: Not all .wav files will work. It is best to use .wav files that have a bitrate of around 352kbps, 512kbps, and 1411 kbps. It is known that
  23024 kbps (4800 sample rate) will NOT work.

# Updates:
  7-29-2020 - Cateogorize OST and SFX wav Files, still need to fix weird .jar file exporting and project troubles. ALC10 being called a class that eclipse can't find. Some dependancy or something else is screwing with this.

  12-30-2020 - A jar file for library integration will be coming soon.
  
  1-1-2021 - First rough, operational jar released (see [releases](https://github.com/Sciguy1/BRUCESoundEngine/releases)), deleted .wav files.
