# BRUCESoundEngine #
 **Still developing and in its rough stages**
 
  A sound engine that can be used in homebrew games/engines. Uses LWJGL 3.x and parts of 2.x for ease of use with OpenAL.
  Note: The size is half due to the wav files, you can have the option of removing those, as this is still being tested
  with additional functionality.

# Updates:

  12-30-2020 - A jar file for library integration will be coming soon.
  
  1-1-2020 - First rough, operational jar released (see releases), deleted .wav files.
